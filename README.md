Parallel Computing with Python
==============================

[IPython notebook which illustrates a few simple ways of doing parallel computing in a single machine with multiple cores.](https://github.com/rsnemmen/parallel-python-tutorial/blob/master/Parallel%20Computing%20with%20Python%20public.ipynb) 

[Tutorial on how to do parallel computing using an IPython cluster.](https://github.com/rsnemmen/parallel-python-tutorial/blob/master/Parallel%20Computing%20with%20Python%20SSH.ipynb)

Practical examples included:

1. Parallel function mapping to a list of arguments (multiprocessing module)
2. Parallel execution of array function (scatter/gather) + parallel execution of scripts with IPython.parallel
3. Easy parallel Monte Carlo (IPython parallel magics)

Based on the talk I gave at [CosmoClub](http://www.iag.usp.br/labcosmos/en/), [IF USP](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/).
